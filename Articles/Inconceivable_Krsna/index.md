Krsna is so great and inconceivable...

Initially I tried to understand everything logically. Then after a certain period I understood that understanding Krsna in truth (evam yo vetti tattvatah) actually means realizing thr fact that we can't understand him completely. So, now if ai don't understand something, I have no hesitation to take it as inconceivable potency of Lord and infinitesimal brain of mine. People generally ask me many logical questions and most of them are satisfied. But actually I just counter their arguments tactfully. They think they have understood Krsna but I just tricked them. Actually Krsna can't br understood. At least in our current corrupted situation.

E.g. one person asked me, why Krsna made the law of karma in such a way that sins from prev life can also affect current one. Why so? It should be like instant result within one lifetime. So I just countered with few arguments. But the point is while asking questions about Krsna we should have a proper attitude. We can't question Krsna He is svarat...
