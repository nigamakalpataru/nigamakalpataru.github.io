## From Villain to Hero : An Introspective Analysis

Suppose someone warns me again and again, there's a 11000V line, DON'T TOUCH IT. And I completely ignore it and touch it, then I get terribly burnt and blame that person “you are so cruel, you knew this beforehand, still you didn't save me”....

Isn't it a story of a GREAT FOOL!!! Yes it is, and we are the main character of this allegorical story. 

Krsna warned us again and again in Bhagavad Gita - don't be attached to the fruits of your actions, my dear soul. That's very very dangerous, please don't do that. From the beginning to end in the Gita Krsna emphasizes this fact. In the second, third, fifth, literally in every chapter the same message. And in the chapter twelve 12.8-11 Krsna literally pleads folding his hands that my dear soul, if you can fix your mind in me that's excellent, but if you can't, then do whatever you like but please please please don't get attached to the fruits of your action. 

But alas! In spite of repeated warnings we commit the dangerous mistake, we try to enjoy this material world by getting attached to fruits of our action. We prioritize things in this world, relationships in this world over Krsna. Then someday Maya gives us a sound kick, our possessions are taken away at once and guess what?? Suddenly Krsna becomes the villain of our life, we start blaming Him as if he had no other work other than destroying our life. 

So, this is going on. And if you ask people around, they are saying “I know everything in Gita and it's all about "Work is worship" (Kam karte jao, fal ki chinta mat karo). “

The kicks of maya are so powerful that it affects everyone (even devotees). For a non devotee there’s no hope, but if you’re a devotee, you’ll realize after receiving the kick that Krsna warned me beforehand, I was in illusion. You will return back to Krsna and will be grateful to Him. Then you’ll realize that Krsna is our true friend and well wisher, the real Hero… Not the Villain of our life.
